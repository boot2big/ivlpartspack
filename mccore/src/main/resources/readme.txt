If you can read this, you'd better know what you're doing in here!
We do not take responsibility for game crashes, corrupted worlds, lost items or general misfortune caused by modification of IVLPP's (or other packs/mods) assets.

Aside from that I'm not gonna be one of those snooty pack authors who tell you not to rummage through my pack. In fact aside from the legally-absolving disclaimer seen above, I *dare* you to look through it and see what makes my creation tick!
I hope it sparks some inspiration and leads you to create your own pack, in which case you're entirely free to take inspiration, reverse-engineer or outright copy any JSONs from my pack. (Maybe come up with'cher own models though so it isn't *too* obvious, you get me? Eheh.)
